## Weather Dashboard

In this application I attempted to use OpenWeatherAPI and JavaScript to develop a 5 day weather forecast so that whenever anyone searches a city they are presented with todays current weather and the weather for the next 5 days. I was able to use JavaScript to log data into the console but am still working out how to get everything added to my webpage so that I can finish styling everything inside.

I had a lot of help from my TA's, rewatching class lectures, and my tutor Abdullah
