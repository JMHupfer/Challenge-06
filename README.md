## Weather Dashboard

In this application I attempted to use OpenWeatherAPI and JavaScript to develop a 5 day weather forecast so that whenever anyone searches a city they are presented with todays current weather and the weather for the next 5 days. I was able to use JavaScript to log data into the console and have an interactive UI where user can search for a city and be presented with a 5 day forecast offering minimum and maximum temperature. 

I had a lot of help from my TA's, rewatching class lectures, and my tutor Abdullah
